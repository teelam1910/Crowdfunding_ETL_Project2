# Crowdfunding-ETL Project


## Description
In this ETL mini project, an ETL pipeline has been constructed using Python and Pandas. Data has been extracted and transformed using Python dictionary methods and/or regular expressions, and four CSV files have been created. From these files, an ERD and a table schema has been created and the CSV dataloaded into a Postgres database.

## Installation
Pandas//NumPy//PgAdmin//QuickDBD

## Usage
This project is a hands-on exercise that reinforces ETL processes, database management, and data manipulation

## Process
### Testing
-Verify that the data extracted from the source files retains its integrity throughout the transformation and loading process.
-Check that the data transformation operations produce the expected results. This includes verifying data formatting, cleaning, and calculations.
-Ensure that the data is loaded correctly into the PostgreSQL database tables without loss or corruption.
-Validate the quality of the data after transformation and loading. 
-Confirm that the database schema matches the expected structure defined in the ERD and table schema.
-Evaluate the performance of the ETL process.
-Perform end-to-end testing of the entire ETL pipeline to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
